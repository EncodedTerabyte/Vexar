fix len function not working with pointers to array (create a possible function to conert pointers to arrays into regular arrays)
function overloading
return multiple values (tuples)
user-defined structs
dynamic lists (like std::vector)
maps/dictionaries (optional but useful)
constant variables (const or let)
enums
type inference
function pointers or lambdas
operator overloading
64-bit and 32-bit integer support
later down the line, implement stuff like containers for std->readLine() for example
